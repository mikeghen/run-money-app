# Run Money

Run Money is a savings game you play with your running buddies. It merges Strava running clubs with web3 wallets for a unique "run-to-earn" experience that encourages saving money and being active. Runners join clubs, stake USDC, and track their activity via the Strava application on their phone. Clubs have requirements for activity. If a runner doesn't meet the club's requirements, they can be slashed by other members. They will lose their USDC stake and it is redistributed to compliant members. At the end of the club duration, successful runners can reclaim their stake along with interest and additional rewards, promoting commitment and discipline.
